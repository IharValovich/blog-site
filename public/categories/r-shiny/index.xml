      <description>Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.
Why Shiny?  Easy to learn, easy to use. The development time is minimized. Excellent tool for data visualization. Have very strong backing: the R language Fun &amp;amp; Cool.</description>

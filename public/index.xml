      <description>Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.
Why Shiny?  Easy to learn, easy to use. The development time is minimized. Excellent tool for data visualization. Have very strong backing: the R language Fun &amp;amp; Cool.</description>

      <description>R Markdown: what, why and how?R Markdown allows to generate a report (most of the time in PDF, HTML, Word or as a beamer presentation) that is automatically generated from a file written within RStudio. The generated documents can serve as a neat record of your analysis that can be shared and published in a detailed and complete report. Even if you never expect to present the results to someone else, it can also be used as a personal notebook to look back so you can see what you did at that time.</description>

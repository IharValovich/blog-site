      <description>R Markdown: what, why and how?R Markdown allows to generate a report (most of the time in PDF, HTML, Word or as a beamer presentation) that is automatically generated from a file written within RStudio. The generated documents can serve as a neat record of your analysis that can be shared and published in a detailed and complete report. Even if you never expect to present the results to someone else, it can also be used as a personal notebook to look back so you can see what you did at that time.</description>

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.

### Why Shiny?

* Easy to learn, easy to use.
* The development time is minimized.
* Excellent tool for data visualization.
* Have very strong backing: the R language
* Fun & Cool.

### A Shiny app usually contains two parts:

1. UI: controls the outlook of the web page
2. Server: (a live R session) controls the logic

### How does Shiny app work?

The “Server” keeps monitoring the UI. Whenever there is a change in the UI, the “Server” will follow some instructions (run some R code) accordingly and update the UI’s display.
